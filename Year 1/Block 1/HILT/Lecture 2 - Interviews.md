title: Lecture 2 - Interviews
---

Predict questions, prepare answers, and practice saying them out loud.

# Types of Interviews
"Tell me about yourself" - Assume they don't have your CV in front of them. Bring it to life. 2 minutes roughly to answer the question. Sell yourself. Make sure that you have a good, strong, and definitive finish. Two-way street.

Technical interview preparation, being given prompts or questions and having to explain your thought process and solution. - Could be online aptitude test spatial awareness, reasoning, all that whatnot.

Group interview (Where multiple applicants are all in same room) could be the same questions to all candidates or changing. Easier for employer to compare between applicants.

Strengths based interview is more about you understanding yourself and what you're good at. What motivates you
	- What's always at the bottom of your to do list?
	- What's the stuff you'll always get done?
	- What's a good day to you?
	- Are you a starter or a finisher?

To get a clueless interview back on track:
Would it be useful if I gave you a rundown of my CV, my achievements to date, and why I want to join your company?

# Tell Me About Yourself
Tell me about yourself!
	- Assume they don't have your CV in front of you
	1) Education
	2) Skills and competencies
	3) Work experience
	4) Strong Finish

Try find a project or something you've done that links with the work they do / is relevant
Be confident about your abilities. 
Don't say all the things you've prepared, pace it and give them the summary.
Strong finish - Talk about why you want to get this residency. Reflects back on your cover letter, talk about what you can bring to the company.

Don't memorise your spiel by rote - it should be different every single time you tell it.

What is a competency? - The ability to do something successfully or efficiently.

# Job Description
Look at the job description for clues as to what questions they're going to ask.

What to do when you get a curveball question:
- Use the STARR structure to keep you on track
- **Use PRA - Pause, Repeat, Answer**
- **_"Nothing is coming to me right now, do you mind asking me that again at the end?"_**
- Interviewers prefer candidates to take a breath, take a few seconds. "That's great, the candidate is thinking (considering) their answer."
- Don't be afraid of silence.
- Ok to ask the interviewer to rephrase the question, to paraphrase. "Can I just clarify, are you asking me about XXXXXX?"

Obviously the wording isn't going to be the same:

| Competency                           | Question                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Use a highlighter to identify key words that can indicate what questions they'll ask.

# STARR
Use this to guide yourself through "Tell me about a time when you XXXXX" questions. Try and keep everything in chronological order. Don't hop between different times; minimise confusion. This should be somewhat different each time, but the bones should remain the same.

Come up with keywords, e.g Teamwork => Open Day Example.

Gives you structure, focus, certainty, confidence, and evidence that you have what they're looking for.
### Situation
Describe the situation you faced. Give as much detail as possible.
### Task
Be specific about what you had to do/solve/organise.
### Action
What actions did YOU take? Start with a **strong verb**.
- I decided
- I asked
- I contacted
- I organised
### Result
How did it work out? What was the outcome achieved because of your actions? **Quantify it.** e.g "We were supposed to finish it in 10 hours, we finished it in 5."
### Reflection
What did you learn? If you were going to do it again, would you do anything differently?
