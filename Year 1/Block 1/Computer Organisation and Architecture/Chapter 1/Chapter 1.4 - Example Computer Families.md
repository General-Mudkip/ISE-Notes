There are various popular [[Instruction Set Architecture|instruction set architectures (ISAs)]]. These include the following:
- x86: Descended from the original Intel 8086. Large, bloated, and complex instruction set. Co-licensed by AMD and Intel. Used in Windows and Linux PCs.
- ARM: Based on the [[RISC|RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)]] ISA. A somewhat open standard that can be licensed by any company. There two main [licenses available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family#Licensing).
	- Core License: These companies are not really allowed to design their *own* cores using the ARM ISA, but are allowed to create chips based off of ARM's design.
	- Architectural License: Much more expensive, but companies *are* allowed to design their own CORE using the ARM ISA. Companies that have this license include Apple (M1/M2/etc.), Qualcomm, and Fujitsu.
