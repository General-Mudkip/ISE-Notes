## 1.3.1 - Technological and Economic Forces 

The computer industry is innovating at a rapid pace. The primary driving force of this push forward is the ability of chip manufacturers to pack more and more [[Transitor|transistors]] per chip every year. More transistors means more memory and more powerful processors.

Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, predicted that the increase in the number of transistors per chip would continue uninterrupted for decades to come. This is nowadays know as "[[Moore's Law]]", and is often expressed as the doubling of the number of transistors every 18 months.

Moore's Law (Not really a law, more a very good prediction and testament to the skill and talent of chip designers), has led to what economists call a **virtuous circle**. Advances in technology (In this case, transistors per chip) lead to better products and lower prices. Lower prices lead to new applications, and new applications lead to new markets and new companies springing up to take advantage of them. The existence of these companies leads to competition, which in turn creates economic demand for better technologies with which to beat others. The circle is complete!
