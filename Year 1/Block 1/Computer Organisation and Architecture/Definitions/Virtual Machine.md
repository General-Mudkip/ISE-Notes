## Definition
The term "virtual machine" has two different meanings in computer science:
1) A program that is able to run an [[operating system]] within another operation system, through use of [[Virtualisation]].
2) A hypothetical (unrealistic) computer whose [[machine code|machine language]] is L1, as opposed to [[L0 Language|L0]]. It may be helpful to imagine that when writing code in a higher-level (L1,L2,etc.) language, that it is not getting translated/compiled, but instead running on a "virtual machine" that can directly run that code.
