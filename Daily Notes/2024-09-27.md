### Universal Serial Bus (USB)
Is a standard, but has a lot of different plug types.
- Most are not reversible. USB-C solved this.

Design goals included elimination of jumpers and switches on boards, remove the need to open the PC to add devices, devices can be powered from the bus, support real-time devices, hot-pluggable, and inexpensive.

Has 4 different types of frames:
- Control
- Isochronous (Time based)
- Bulk (e.g mass storage device, printer)
- Interrupt (e.g keyboards, mice)
