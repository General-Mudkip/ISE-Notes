### 10 Actions to ensure a great residency
1) **Look ahead**
	1) Talk to the current second/third years who have been on their residencies. Find out the nature of the work, what the average day is like, which companies are really into spaces that you're interested in (e.g AI).
	2) Often tasks/job description doesn't reflect reality.
2) **Engage**
	1) Get stuff in on time, especially when it comes to paperwork (e.g emergency tax)
	2) Double check everything, be ready for the first day
3) **Eat**
	1) Look after your personal health.
	2) Prioritise it; no prizes for not taking lunch
	3) Ask colleagues to join them
4) **15/15**
	1) Arrive 15 minutes before your scheduled start
	2) Leave 15 minutes after the scheduled end
5) **What's expected?**
	1) Be clear with your supervisor/manager about what they're expecting from you
	2) Ask them questions in the interview
	3) "How do I know that I'm doing a good job?"
	4) "What does a great worker look like?"
	5) Keep an eye on your metrics, that you're hitting the mark
6) **Observe**
	1) Watch what's going on around you
	2) Look at how people play off each other.
		1) Casual?
		2) Formal?
		3) Still stay professional though.
	3) Don't be on your phone. Check every half-hour/hour
7) **Notebook**
	1) A physical notebook makes it look like you're more engaged
	2) Use a notebook for external meetings/meetings in general
	3) Write down what's happening, what you need to get done
	4) Jot down each week's events (For CV, report, and own knowledge)
8) **Networking/Build Relationships**
	1) Get to know people inside *and* outside of your department.
	2) Join in the social/sports clubs
9) **Put your hand up**
	1) Volunteer to take on additional responsibilities
		1) Only if you have the time, skills, etc.
		2) Don't overload yourself working 70 hour weeks.
	2) Get involved
	3) Put your hand up when you don't know
		1) Paraphrase, put it in your own language
		2) Ask them to rephrase it
		3) Ensure that you know what they're asking you to do.
10) **Feedback**
	1) Make sure to get feedback recently; whether it be positive or negative.
		1) Have autonomy though. Don't be asking them three times a day.
		2) Formalise it; ask if you could meet every fortnight to evaluate your performance.
	2) Ask the manager their preferred style of communication; by text? phone? in-person?
	3) Try to develop yourself based on it
	4) Get feedback from your interview. Ask them why you were rejected, what went wrong.
11) **Celebrate the little wins**

## My own reference ðŸ˜Ž

Bence is an excellent team player, prepared to work with anyone that he needs to in order to get things done. His technical skills are also exceptional, being able to tackle most problems we throw at him, while being ready to ask for help whenever he gets stuck. He puts himself out there, getting to know the people around him and forming deep connections with them that often extend out of the workplace.
