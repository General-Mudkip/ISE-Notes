# Markitechture Lecture 1: ISA

### Difference between Latch and Flip-Flop
- Latch: Level-triggered
- Flip-Flop: Edge-triggered

### What is the valid bit used for in cache?
On power-up, valid bit is 0 to indicate that the cache line doesn't contain useful data. In a multi-core system, if Core A writes new data to a cache line that Core B also has (in different caches, i.e L1/L2), then Core A must then mark Core B's cache line as invalid (valid bit = 0),

## Instruction Set Architecture
- The **lowest level** that we as software engineers can access.
- The instructions we give to the microprocessor are in [[Machine Code]].
	- We don't use machine code - We use assembly language - which is then translated to machine code
	- Most compilers will compile code straight into machine code, without any intermediary steps.
- Machine code is a general purpose abstraction used to allow multiple languages to run code on the CPU

### Memory Models
- A **memory space** is **byte-addressable**. That means that each unique address can access one unique byte.
	- In a 32-bit architecture, memory space is 4GiB (2^32 - 1)
	- In a 64-bit architecture, memory space is 16EiB (2^64 - 1)
- If a data type is more than 1-byte long (e.g longs, doubles, strings, etc.) the address refers to the **first byte** of the data-type.
- Sometimes, data types **must** be aligned, but they always should be.
	- ![[Memory alignment.png]]
- It is possible to have separate address spaces for instructions and memory, but neither x86 nor ARM do this.
	- This is not the same as a **split cache**, where addresses and data are stored in two different caches.

## Registers
- These are fast, on-chip local temporary storage.
- Normally register size is the same as the architecture size (either 32 or 64 bit)
- Some registers can be accessed using a lower size (``al`` and ``ax`` in x86 are 8 and 16 bit registers respectively.)
	- Note that these registers **share space** with their larger alternatives. If you write to ``al`` and then check ``ax``, the first 8 bits of ``al`` *will be* `ax.
- Registers can be general purpose (`ax`, `bx`, etc.) or **special purpose** (`ip`; instruction pointer, `sp`: stack pointer, etc.)

## Condition Codes
- CPUs have a special register called the **Program Status Word (PSW)**
- This register contains a number of bits called **flags** that represent the result of the last arithmetic or compare instruction. On ARM these are:
	- N = result is negative
	- Z = result is zero
	- V = result is an overflow
	- C = addition or subtraction resulted in a carry
	- P = result had odd parity

# 5.2 - Data Types

- Data types in the ISA world are limited. There are no objects or classes, just simple integers and floats.
- Integers:
	- 8 through 64 bits
- Floating points:
	- 32-bits (**single precision**, `float` in C)
	- 64-bits (**double precision**m `double` in C)
- Strings:
	- The ISA doesn't really support strings, but some operations can operate on a sequence of bytes.

## Signed and Unsigned Quantities
- General integers are **signed**, meaning that they can be positive or negative.
- Signed:
	- A byte can be from -128 to +127
	- A short can be from -32768 to +32767
	- A long can be from -2147483648 to +2147483647
- Unsigned:
	- A byte can be from 0 to 255
	- A short can be from 0 to 65535
	- A long can be from 0 to 4294967295


# Lecture 2

## Instruction Formats
- x86 = Complicated, ARM = EZ
- There is a **variable number of bytes per instruction**.
	- The **opcode** (Instruction to run) itself is 1 or 2 bytes.
	- There could be up to 5 bytes of **prefixes**.
	- There may be other bytes, wild stuff.
- **ARM** is neater and smaller (Keep in mind it's [[RISC]])
	- All instructions are 32-bit aligned
	- All instructions contain condition bits (less need for conditional jumps)

## Machine Code
- The binary executed by CPUs
- It is normally written in [[hexadecimal]] and is [[byte aligned]] (x86) or 4-byte aligned (ARM)
- Difficult for humans to read/write it
- The assembler is the program that [[Translation|translate]]s assembly language to machine code
- Compilers translate directly to machine code, skipping over assembly. (Typically)
