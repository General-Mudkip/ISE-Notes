## Intro to Programming - Lecture 1

Sentinel controlled iteration (Indefinite iteration) - The number of iterations is not known before the loop begins executing.

Sentinel value - (Signal, dummy, flag value) - Can be used to indicate "end of data entry"

Top-down, step-wise refinement - Begin with one line that says what you want to do, then work on from there. Divide the top into a series of smaller tasks and list these in the order in which they'll be performed.

Unary cast operators - (double) creates a temporary floating point copy of its operand.

Cast operator performs **explicit conversion** (or type casting.)

Promotion/implicit conversion is performed on operands. In an expression containing an `int` and a `double`, the `int` will be **promoted** to a `double`.

Compound assignment operators shorten operations. e.g +=, -=, \*=, /=, %=

++ or -- increments/decrements its operand.

If placed before a variable, it is a **prefix increment/decrement operator**, If place after a variable, it is a **postfix increment/decrement operator**.

Java is **strongly typed.**

- "Two wrongs don't make a non binary." - Me (Genius)
- "Litter is just sparkleless glitter" - Holly
- "Ryan murdered me, but here I am still talking two hours later. So I guess you can't keep a good thing down" - Josh McGiff
