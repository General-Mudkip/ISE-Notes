title: How to write new chapter notes
---

Here's the general process for how to write notes for a new chapter.

1) If it does not already exist, create the directory for the chapter under the correct parent directories. e.g Year 1 > Block 1 > Computer Organisation > Chapter 1. Generally the structure should look something like this:
	- Year (Directory)
		- Block (Directory)
			- Module (Directory)
				- Chapter `x` (Directory)
					- Chapter `x.y` (Markdown file)
						- Chapter `x.y.z` (Heading)
				- Definitions (Directory)
					- The various terms (Markdown files)
2) Ideally attend the lecture, and wait until the topic has been completely covered to write out the notes.
3) Scan through the chapter and add any new terms to the glossary, in the "Definitions" directory for that module.
4) Write the notes for the chapter.
